# avr-uart-driver

UART low level driver for AVR devices.

## Supported Devices

The driver has been developed to keep a flexible and simple way to add support for new devices by writting specific Hardware Abstraction Layer C++ class for each microcontroller.

List of current AVR devices that are supported:

- ATmega48A/48PA/88A/88PA/168A/168PA/328/328P.
- ATmega640/1280/1281/2560/2561.
